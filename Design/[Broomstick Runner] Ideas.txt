That time I couldn't debug because someone was using my License for ArcGIS Pro, so I decided to just design a cool little game that I will be making in Godot very very soon. 


The game is about a Witch that flies around delivering her services.

The game is made up of two parts. First is managing your Witch, Second is flying around destinations in order to make deliveries and complete missions etc. 

First we shall focus on the Flying to Destination part of the game, which is going to be a Runner game. 
Witch on Broomstick, the game gives you three lanes and you have to switch around them avoiding obstacles and collecting stuff. 

Stuff to include for this: 
-Player Health Bar.
-Player Speed
-Progress Bar 
-Obstacles{ Parameters: Damage, Slow %, Slow Duration, Weaknesses?, Ghostly?) obstacles like collectibles move at a fixed pace as the Witch progresses. - Weaknesses show the Elements that can affect these Obstacles, all other elements are blocked. - Ghostly means that your Projectiles can fly through it. 
-Enemies unlike Obstacles, they stay at the far edge of the screen. They shoot projectiles and create obstacles for the player. {Health, Health Regen, Fire Rate, Projectile type, Movement Pattern [Pretty much a queue about moving up or down which plays on repeat])
-Projectiles {They are a formation of Obstacles, that moves independenly to the main scrolling}

Collectibles
-Health Orbs
-Currency 1: Money
-Currency 2: Something Magic Related.
-Speed Boost Orbs
-Special Ingredients : Whatever Special Ingredients might exist in this route. 
-RARE COLLECTIBLES : One per region - random chance of appearing/ Low - perhaps they have specific prerequisites.

Before flying off, the Witch can prepare her Route, drawing a line from her Hut's position adding as many waypoints as she wants. The length of this line will directly affect the size of the game level that is generated.
Additional segmentations to the level-> Marking the length at which a region is changed. 

The Witch can decide at what time of the day to start her trip. And the routing tool displays the time it will be required for a trip. 

Quests will expire. 
Also quests might be done for good or for bad. Moving a Karma Bar. 

Flying for more than 24 hours leads to exhaustion -> Speed is reduced, double health is lost 

Enemies will have a timer that shows how close they are to doing their move? 
The player will have a gauge that fills up with Currency 2. Each of their skills would use 1,2 or 3 levels of that Gauge. 
Money can be removed- Bags of money will be added as rare collectibles.
