These functions will be written in a Singleton class and they should be accessible throughout the code.

GetPointAlongLine(PoolVector2DArray Polyline, double DistanceAlongLine):
 -Find between which two Points of the Polyline the given distance is. 
 -Then remove the distance of the previous point to the start and find the Distance From Previous Point.
 -In a straight line from the previous point to the next point, with a length equal to the Distance left {DistanceAlongLine-DistanceFromPreviousPoint}
